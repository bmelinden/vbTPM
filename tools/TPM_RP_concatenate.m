% x=TPM_RP_concatenate(lacX,lacY)
%
% function to transform raw data in the form 
%  lacX: {[M1 x120x B1 double]  ... [M4 x120x B4 double] }
%  lacY: {[M1 x120x B1 double]  ... [M4 x120x B4 double] }
% to 
%  x{i}{j} = [Mi*120 x 2 double], where i is the set index, and j is the bead
%
% This is the raw data format of xy-coordinate data saved by the RP group
% analysis software (as of now)
