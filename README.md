vbTPM is a program suite for analysis of tethered particle motion
data, using a variational Bayes approach to Hidden Markov models. The
program runs on Matlab, but uses compiled C-code to speed up the most
computer intensive loops.

This a beta version; the code is complete and useable, but the
documentation is still in progress, in parallel with a scientific
paper describing the algorithm and performance on real data.
