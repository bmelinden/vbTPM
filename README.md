vbTPM is a program suite for analysis of tethered particle motion data, using a variational Bayes approach to Hidden Markov models. The program runs on Matlab, but uses compiled C-code to speed up the most computer intensive loops.

This a beta version; the code is quite complete and useable, but the documentation is still in progress, in parallel with a scientific paper describing the algorithm and performance on real data.
