vbTPM is a program suite for analysis of tethered particle motion
data, using a variational Bayes approach to Hidden Markov models. The
program runs on Matlab, but uses compiled C-code to speed up the most
computer intensive loops.

2014-02-02: Release of beta version. Both code and documentation are
fully useable, but the accompanying scientific paper describing the
algorithm and performance on real data is not yet accepted for
publication.
