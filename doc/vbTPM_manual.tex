% some information that is useful for running the VB7 software for
% analyzing TPM traces.

\section{Getting started with vbTPM}
\subsection{Installation}
Get the source code, and make sure VB7, HMMcore, and tools are in your
matlab path.

Make sure that HMMcore/ contains binaries for your systems. If not, a
simple matlab compilation script can be found in HMMcore/.

\subsection{Hardware requirements}
Tethered particle motion often produces large data sets of many long
trajectories, which makes the HMM analysis computer intensive. As an
example, one parameter point in our test data sets, about 90
trajectories averaging 45 min, downsampled to 10 Hz, took about 24 h
to go through on two 6 core Intel Xeon E5645 2.40GHz processors. The
analysis time increases sharply with the number of (spurious) states.

\subsection{Factorial model}
\subsection{Notation and symbols}
\subsection{Large data sets}
Parallellization is achieved by running external scripts that starts
multiple independent Matlab runs, and use the presence of various~.mat
files to coordinate the computations. Repeated restarts of Matlab also
avoids problems with memory performance.

\subsection{Doing empirical Bayes}
Our empirical Bayes analysis of hierarchical models used tailored
scripts\ldots
