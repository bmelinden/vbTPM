\subsection{Installation}
Get the source code, and make sure VB7, HMMcore, and tools are in your
Matlab path, for example by running the script \verb+vbTPMstart+ from
the Matlab command prompt. (To add these paths permanently to your
Matlab path, see the Matlab documentation).

Make sure that HMMcore/ contains binaries for your system
(\texttt{VBforwback.mex[sys], VBwAcount.mex[sys], VBviterbi.mex[sys],
  VBviterbi\_log.mex[sys]}, where \texttt{[sys]} is some
system-dependent extension). If not, a simple Matlab compilation
script can be found in HMMcore/. (See Matlab documentation for how to
set up your mex compiler). For large data sets, it is probably faster
to compile your own binaries.

\subsection{System requirements}
Tethered particle motion often produces large data sets of many long
trajectories, which makes the HMM analysis computer intensive. As an
example, one parameter point in our test data sets, about 90
trajectories averaging 45 min, downsampled to 10 Hz, took about 24 h
to go through on two 6 core Intel Xeon E5645 2.40GHz processors. The
analysis time increases sharply with the number of states (including
spurious ones, like transient sticking events).

vbTPM is implemented in Matlab, tested on R2012a and R2013a, on recent
Mac and Ubuntu Linux systems, and requires the signal processing and
statistics toolboxes.

Windows users will have to do some scripting to translate the
bash-based parallelization scheme (below) to some other script
language, but should be fine otherwise.

\subsection{A small test problem}
A small test problem can be found in example1/, with the actual data
in example1/lacdata/.  The data set has one calibration (cal) and one
production (trj) trajectory for each bead, and contains data from five
beads. Using the runinput2.m and runscript2.sh files as described
below, this data set takes less than 30 min to analyze on the above
machine (running all five trajectories in parallel).

\subsection{Runinput files} 
Runinput files contain all parameters to run the analysis and access
the results. The meaning of the parameters are documented below, and
via comments in the runinput files in example1/.  \verb+runinput1.m+
refers to an already completed analysis (results in
example1/HMMresults1/), while \verb+runinput2.m+ has not yet run.

The runinput files are parsed by executing them as Matlab scripts,
which makes it possible to use Matlab commands to define variables,
for example loading filename lists. It also opens the dangerous
possibility to interfere with the analysis code though (be careful when
introducing temporary variables).

Relative paths specified in runinput files are interpreted relative to
the location of the runinput file.

\texttt{VB7\_getOptions} parses the runinput file and returns a Matlab
struct with all runinput parameters as subfields.

\subsection{Run basic analysis on single trajectories}
To start analyzing the test data set, type
\verb+VB7_batch_run('runinput2')+ in the Matlab command prompt. Since
the runinput file has \verb+one_at_a_time=true;+ this will analyze one
trajectory in the data set. Several calls are needed to complete the
analysis. 

Setting \verb+one_at_a_time=false;+ will run analysis of all
trajectories in the data set. In our experience however, Matlab tends
to hoard memory when several large data sets are analyzed
consecutively.  To work around that, one can use scripts that starts
consecutive Matlab sessions and runs a single trajectory in each.

One example for the bash shell is \verb+runscript1.sh+, which calls
\verb+runinput1.m+ (there is also a corresponding
\verb+runscript2.sh+).

\subsubsection*{Parallelization}
To parallellize, run several instances of the above script at once,
with \verb+one_at_a_time=true;+ in the runinput
file. \verb+VB7_batch_run+ keeps track of which trajectories have
already been 'checked out', so it is also possible to run on several
computers, if the results folder is synced regularly. If the same
trajectory is checked out multiple times on different computers, old
results are simply overwritten (no harm done if they used the same
runinput file).

\subsubsection*{Manage the analysis}
\verb+VB7_batch_manage+ is a tool for managing the basic analysis. It
can collect the results and write them to a file or return them to the
Matlab workspace, count how many trajectories in a data set has been
analyzed, and also clean up temporary files from unfinished
trajectories, which is useful if an analysis run is interrupted.

By default, collected analysis results are written to a file named
\texttt{[PIDprefix]\_results.mat} (\texttt{PIDprefix} is a string set
in the runinput file), in the \texttt{[target\_path]/} folder (see
also table \ref{tab:results}).

\subsubsection*{Inspect and classify the results} 
The GUI for manual state classification is called
\verb+VB7_batch_postprocess()+, outlined in
Fig.~\ref{fig:postprocess}. The GUI can be used to inspect the
analysis results in detail, and can also start a conversion of the
simple HMM models to factorial models for further (manual)
analysis. To try it out, use the runinput file \verb+runinput1.m+,
which is already analyzed. To access the fitted models directly, use
\verb+VB7_batch_manage+ with the 'collect' option. The results are
returned as cell vectors for calibration and production trajectories,
with the same index structure as the filenames in the runinput file.

The results of the state classification are written to
\texttt{[PIDprefix]\_results\_analyzed.mat} (in the
\texttt{[target\_path]/} folder) and factorial models are similarly
written to \texttt{[PIDprefix]\_results\_analyzed.mat\_VB7kin.mat}.

For details on how vbTPM represents the models and contents of results
files etc., we refer to section \ref{sec:notation}.

\subsection{Input data format}
vbTPM reads individual trajectories as column matrices, one column for
x- and one for y-positions, with sampling frequency specified by
\texttt{fSample} in the runinput file. If the data is not already
drift-corrected, vbTPM can do this using a first-order Butterworth
filter (\texttt{driftcorrection=true;}) with cut-off frequency
\texttt{fCut}.

Each trajectory is supplied in an individual .mat file, which could
either contain a Matlab struct (in which case vbTPM will read the
field specified by \texttt{calibration\_xyfield} or
\texttt{looping\_xyfield}, same for all trajectories), or just the
position trace matrix (by setting the xyfield parameters to empty
strings).

Trajectories filenames are supplied as string cell vectors
\texttt{calibration\_filename} and \texttt{looping\_filename}
containing in the runinput file. The latter is nested, to allow
several production traces per calibration run. Calibration and looping
trajectories is analyzed with different model search parameters, and
it is usually a good idea to spend more restarts
(\texttt{restarts\_cal, restarts\_trj}) and larger initial number of
states (\texttt{Ninit\_cal, Ninit\_trj}) on the looping data than on
the calibration data. All traces are analyzed individually however, so
it is possible to use this structure to organize the data in a
different way.
