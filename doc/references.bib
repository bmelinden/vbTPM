It is also an important starting point for analyzing the behavior of more complex systems such as networks and solutions of semiflexible polymers. To estimate the validity of the obtained analytical expressions, we also determine the distribution function numerically using Monte Carlo simulation and find good quantitative agreement.},

The results are in the form of infinite continued fractions, which are obtained by exploiting the hierarchical structure of a moment-based expansion of the partition function. The case of an imaginary force corresponds to the end-to-end distance distribution in {LaplaceFourier} space. We illustrate the utility of these exact results by examining the structure factor of a wormlike chain, the deformation free energy of a chain in a nematic field, and the self-consistent-field solution for the isotropicnematic transition of wormlike chains.},

	abstract = {We find exact expressions for the end-to-end distance vector distribution function with fixed end orientations for the wormlike chain model. This function in {Fourier-Laplace} space adopts the form of infinite continued fractions, which emerges upon exploiting the hierarchical structure of the moment-based expansion. Our results are used to calculate the root-mean-square end displacement in a given direction for a chain with both end orientations fixed. We find that the crossover from rigid to flexible chains is marked by the root-mean-square end displacement slowly losing its angular dependence as the coupling between chain conformation and end orientation wanes. However, the coupling remains strong even for relatively flexible chains, suggesting that the end orientation strongly influences chain conformation for chains that are several persistence lengths long. We then show the behavior of the distribution function by a density plot of the probability as a function of the end-to-end distance vector for a wormlike chain in two dimensions with one end pointed in a fixed direction and the other end free (in its orientation). As we progress from high to low rigidity, the distribution function shifts from being peaked at a location near the full contour length of the chain in the forward direction, corresponding to a straight configuration, to being peaked near zero end separation, as in the Gaussian limit. The function exhibits double peaks in the crossover between these limiting behaviors.},

The {DNA} is modeled by the wormlike chain model, and the probability of loop formation is calculated in two ways: exact numerical evaluation of the constrained path integral and the extension of the Shimada and Yamakawa saddle point approximation. For example, we find that the looping free energy of a 100-base-pairs {DNA} decreases from 24 {kBT} to 13 {kBT} when the loop is closed by a protein of r=10 nm length. It further decreases to 5 {kBT} when the loop has a kink of 120° at half-length.},

We show how to infer kth order Markov chains, for arbitrary k, from finite data by applying Bayesian methods to both parameter estimation and model-order selection. Extending existing results for multinomial models of discrete data, we connect inference to statistical mechanics through information-theoretic (type theory) techniques. We establish a direct relationship between Bayesian evidence and the partition function which allows for straightforward calculation of the expectation and variance of the conditional relative entropy and the source entropy rate. Finally, we introduce a method that uses finite data-size scaling with model-order comparison to infer the structure of out-of-class processes.},

Single molecule force spectroscopy has the unique capability to follow such reactions but Brownian fluctuations in the end-to-end distance of a {DNA} tether can obscure these events. Here we measured the force-induced unwrapping of {DNA} from a single nucleosome and show that hidden Markov analysis, adopted for the nonlinear force-extension of {DNA,} can readily resolve unwrapping events that are significantly smaller than the Brownian fluctuations. The resulting probability distributions of the tether length are used to accurately resolve small changes in contour length and persistence length. The latter is shown to be directly related to the {DNA} bending angle of the complex. The wormlike chain-adapted hidden Markov analysis can be used for any transient {DNA-protein} complex and provides a robust method for the investigation of these transient events.},

	abstract = {Time series data provided by single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer {(sm-FRET)} experiments offer the opportunity to infer not only model parameters describing molecular complexes, e.g. rate constants, but also information about the model itself, e.g. the number of conformational states. Resolving whether or how many of such states exist requires a careful approach to the problem of model selection, here meaning discriminating among models with differing numbers of states. The most straightforward approach to model selection generalizes the common idea of maximum likelihood-selecting the most likely parameter values-to maximum evidence: selecting the most likely model. In either case, such inference presents a tremendous computational challenge, which we here address by exploiting an approximation technique termed variational Bayes. We demonstrate how this technique can be applied to temporal data such as {smFRET} time series; show superior statistical consistency relative to the maximum likelihood approach; and illustrate how model selection in such probabilistic or generative modeling can facilitate analysis of closely related temporal data currently prevalent in biophysics. Source code used in this analysis, including a graphical user interface, is available open source via {http://vbFRET.sourceforge.net}},

	abstract = {The tetrameric Lac repressor can bind simultaneously to two lac operators on the same {DNA} molecule, thereby including the formation of a {DNA} loop. We investigated the phasing dependence of {DNA} loop formation between lac operator O1 and an auxiliary ideal lac operator {(O(id))} on the bacterial chromosome, with inter-operator distances varying from 57.5 to 1493.5 bp. Repression of a {CAP-independent} lac {UV5} promoter by O1 at its natural position increased up to 50-fold in the presence of an optimally positioned auxiliary O(id)). Repression values alternated between local maxima and minima with a periodicity of 11.0 to 11.3 bp, suggesting that the chromosomal helical repeat is in this range in vivo. Repression increased significantly with decreasing inter-operator {DNA} length, indicating that the local Lac repressor concentration at O1 is crucial for tight repression. Maximal repression, attributed to stable {DNA} loop formation, was obtained at an operator spacing of 70.5 bp. Other repression maxima occurred at operator distances of 92.5 and 115.5 bp, corresponding to natural operator spacings in the lac and in the gal operon, respectively. Substitution of the auxiliary O(id) with the weaker binding lac operator O3 lowered repression efficiency, presumably due to the reduced local concentration of Lac repressor.},

	abstract = {Dynamic systems biology models typically involve many kinetic parameters, the quantitative determination of which has been a serious obstacle to using these models. Previous work showed for a particular model that useful predictions could be extracted from a fit long before the experimental data constrained the parameters, even to within orders of magnitude. This was attributed to a “sloppy” pattern in the model's parameter sensitivities; the sensitivity eigenvalues were roughly evenly spaced over many decades. Consequently, the model behavior depended effectively on only a few “stiff” parameter combinations. Here we study the converse problem, showing that direct parameter measurements are very inefficient at constraining the model's behavior. To yield effective predictions, such measurements must be very precise and complete; even a single imprecise parameter often destroys predictivity. We also show here that the characteristic sloppy eigenvalue pattern is reproduced in 16 other diverse models from the systems biology literature. The apparent universality of sloppiness suggests that predictions from most models will be very fragile to single uncertain parameters and that collective parameters fits can often yield tight predictions with loose parameters. Together these results argue that focusing on parameter values may be a very inefficient route to useful models.},

	abstract = {Lactose repressor protein {(LacI)} controls transcription of the genes involved in lactose metabolism in bacteria. Essential to optimal {LacI-mediated} regulation is its ability to bind simultaneously to two operators, forming a loop on the intervening {DNA.} Recently, several lines of evidence (both theoretical and experimental) have suggested various possible loop structures associated with different {DNA} binding topologies and {LacI} tetramer structural conformations (adopted by flexing about the C-terminal tetramerization domain). We address, specifically, the role of protein opening in loop formation by employing the single-molecule tethered particle motion method on {LacI} protein mutants chemically cross-linked at different positions along the cleft between the two dimers. Measurements on the wild-type and uncross-linked {LacI} mutants led to the observation of two distinct levels of short tether length, associated with two different {DNA} looping structures. Restricting conformational flexibility of the protein by chemical cross-linking induces pronounced effects. Crosslinking the dimers at the level of the N-terminal {DNA} binding head {(E36C)} completely suppresses looping, whereas cross-linking near the C-terminal tetramerization domain {(Q231C)} results in changes of looping geometry detected by the measured tether length distributions. These observations lead to the conclusion that tetramer opening plays a definite role in at least a subset of {LacI/DNA} loop conformations.},
