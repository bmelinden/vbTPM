% W=VB7_split(W0,ss,TsplitFactor)
% splits genuine state ss into two distinct genuine states, with mean dwell
% times differing by a factor TsplitFactor (each new state gets the
% original ss a factor sqrt(TsplitFactor) bigger or smaller dwell time a
% factor sqrt(TsplitFactor).

% M.L. 2011-01-06   : started
% M.L. 2011-02-03   : translated from VB5 to VB7, new rescaling formulae
% M.L. 2011-02-14   : throw error on split of empty state. Debug thing,
%                     because that problem seems to depend in initiakl
