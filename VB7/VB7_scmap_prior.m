% W1=VB7_scmap_prior(W0,N,Nc)
% generate prior parameters for a mixed model with N genuine and Nc-1
% spurious states, based on the prior parameters for a genuine state-only model
% with N+Nc-1 states.
%
% mixed model: 
% p(st,ct|st-1,ct-1)=A(st-1,st)*(delta(ct-1,1)*Ac(st-1,ct) 
%       + (1-delta(ct-1,1))*Rc(ct-1,ct)
