% opt=VB7_getOptions(runinputfile)
%
% convert HMM runinput parameters from a runinput file into an options
% structure opt. In fact, all variables created by the command
% eval(runinputfile) are stored in the opt structure. 
%
% Additionally, the path part of runinputfile is added to the fields
% source_path and target_paths, so that the position of data and results
% are interpreted as given relative to the position of the runinput file.
