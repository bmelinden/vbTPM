% [x,y,a]=THRregion(thr,Xrange,Yrange,Z,dn);
%
% Thresholded selection from 2D histogram. THRregion finds all (x,y)-values
% such that Z(x,y)> a, where a is a threshold chosen such that 
% sum(Z(Z>a)) / sum(Z) ~ thr
% Xrange, Yrange are vectors of bin centers in the two dimensions, Z is an
% intensity matrix for each bin.

%% change-log
% M.L. 2011-02-04   : added linear term to f(a) to avoid flat regions.
