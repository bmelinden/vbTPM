% [X,T,dt,Xraw]=getBeadXY(source) 
% recover xy-trace from the data files in directory source
% the raw positions are filtered with a 0.1 Hz first order Butterworth
% filter to remove drift.
% M.L. 2010-01-09   : added a loop to cut out the first non-NaN interval
%                     of each time series.
