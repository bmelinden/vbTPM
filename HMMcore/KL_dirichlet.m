% KL=KL_dirichlet(w,u)
% 
% compute the Kullback-Leibler divergence of two Dirichlet distributions
% with parameters w and u,
% KL = KL(w||u) = int p(x|w) ln ( p(x|w) / p(x|u) ) dx
% 
% In addition, elements with u(j)=0 are ignored, equivalent to 
% u=u(find(u~=0));w=w(find(u~=0));
%
% (In the VBHMM setting, w is the variational distribution, and u is the
% prior.)
