% [s,tWarn]=sViterbi(Q,qst)
% most likely trajectory by the Viterbi algorithm
% input Q, qst are the structures W.Q, W.qst in a converged VBE1 object
% (probably works for other algorithms too), i.e.,
% Q is proportional to a transition matrix, and
% qst is proportional to a local emission likelihood
% (see VBE1_VBEiter4.m for code that computes Q, qst that this algorithm is
% intended for).
% tWarn is a list of time points where normalization roblems occur, because
% of numerical underflow.
%
% This is the matlab version of VBviterbi.c, and is kept for debugging and
% benchmarking reasons (the c version is MUCH faster).

% M.L. 2011-12-20 : created a C version, and checked that they agree
%                   numerically.
